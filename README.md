# 🎮 TypeScript + Pixi.js Game Development Bootcamp

Welcome to the Game Dev Learning Repo!

This repository is designed to help you learn how to build games using **TypeScript** and **Pixi.js**, and to prepare you to work on a semi-professional game project as a team.

## 📌 Overview

The learning process is divided into three main stages:

### 1. 🔧 Foundations
- Learn the basics of Git, TypeScript, and Pixi.js.
- Get familiar with the game loop, input handling, sprites, and simple animations.
- Work inside your own personal branch (see below).

### 2. 🎮 Solo Game Project
- Build your own small game using what you've learned.
- Use clean code, clear structure, and modular architecture.
- The best project (based on creativity, structure, and polish) will determine the **Team Leader** for the next stage.

### 3. 🤝 Collaborative Game Development
- Work as a team to design and build a full game.
- Learn to use branches, pull requests, reviews, and task management.
- Follow best practices in game architecture, asset management, and teamwork.
